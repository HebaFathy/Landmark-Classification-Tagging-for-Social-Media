In this project, we took the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. We gone through the machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and deploying an app based on the best CNN you trained.

### The high level steps of the project included:

1- Created a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch), visualized the dataset, and processed it for training.

2- Built a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify the landmarks. 

3- Described some of your decisions around data processing and how you chose your network architecture and exported out best network using Torch Script.

4- Created a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning) .

5- Investigated different pre-trained models and decide on one to use for this classification task. 

6- Along with training and testing this transfer-learned network, explained how we arrived at the pre-trained network we chosed. 

7- Exported our best transfer learning solution using Torch Script.
